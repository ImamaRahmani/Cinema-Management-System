# Cinema-Management-System

**Introduction:**

For thousands of people outing to the cinema is definitely the best way to spend leisure-time, meet with  friends or have fun with family. Today there is a wide range of cinemas, movies and film shows for any  taste and budget. To enjoy your outing, you have to find the film you want then find the cinema that's  showing it, check the times, buy the tickets. Agree, it takes a lot of time and efforts. And here comes our  Cinema Management System.


**Working:**

We are used SQL Server with C# to create our project. The desktop application starts to run when the 
Loading page appears on the screen. Once it is loaded, Login page is displayed where the user adds the 
username and password to login into the application. If wrong username or password is entered, the user 
is informed via message box. Next, the Menu page is shown, giving the user four options: movies, 
audience, ticket, and cancellation. The user can then proceed accordingly. 

**Flowchart:**

Once the user selects movies from the menu, record new movies page is opened. The user will then add the 
details of the movie: name, date, showtime, language, ticket price and seats. Next, click the Add button and
a message will be shown; movie data entered successfully. Now the user can view movies by clicking on 
the view movies button.
In the next page now showing movies will be visible in the table below as we have linked it with the SQL 
Server database so the user can easily see the data that is being entered. Here the user is given three options:
update delete and search. The user can enter the movie name and then search, it will fetch the data of the 
movie where the user can edit them and update accordingly.
